**Project Name**

RecognizeMe - Member of the Week!

**Description**

A simple React app that mimicks a celebration for a Member in our team that has been recognized for the week's effort and work.

**Features**

* Confetti animation
* Team member reveal
* Animated text
* Drumroll and applause audio effects

**Additional Information**

The `MemberCard` component uses a technique called **staggered animation** to animate the team member's information. Staggered animation is a type of animation where each element in a list is animated one at a time, with a delay between each animation. This can create a more interesting and engaging animation than simply animating all of the elements at once.

To implement staggered animation in the `MemberCard` component, we use the `useEffect` hook to create a list of timers. Each timer is set to call the `setShowElements` state function to show one of the team member's elements after a certain delay.

We also use a function called `animateWords` to split the team member's name and accomplishments into individual words and animate each word separately. This creates a more dynamic and eye-catching animation.
